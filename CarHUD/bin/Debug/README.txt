This is a *very* basic speedo script.  I'll add more to it later.  For right now tell me if it's something you'd like to see more of. 

(Since this is being released in the WIP section of the LSPDFR Lounge discord, it's for use by members only.)


REQUIREMENTS
============

Latest RagePluginHook  (1.68.1248.15551 as of the writing of this readme)

INSTALL
=======

Quite simple.  Drag and drop the included folder into your gtav main folder and $PROFIT$!

It won't load automatically.  So either go into your RPH setting and click the autoload option, or simply start it with 

LoadPlugin CarHUD.dll

In the RPH console in game.

DISCLAIMER
==========
I assume no responsibility for anything that happens to your computer while using this plugin.  If your computer catches fire, runs off to the circus, 
or generally misbehaves, it ain't my fault, fool!

Also, if you are one of those fools that thinks it's okay to download and sell other people's content with no intention of sharing your profits with them
then you can burn in hell.  I created this because I wanted a simple speedo.  So if you sell it, it's really no skin off my back.  But honestly, you could've
googled how to do it and read the RAGE documentation and figured it out like me.  Only took me like 3 hours to figure it all out. :)
